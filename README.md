# smart1rv

Smart RV Demand Package estimator for Smart 1 Marketing.

This project creates a multi-step embedded form for RV dealers. The form collects dealer information, creates an AI-generated campground market estimate, and sends the full lead payload into Smart 1 Suite through a webhook.

## What this version does

- Collects RV dealer contact details
- Collects dealer address and website URL
- Collects buyer and service travel radius
- Collects campaign goals and weather-trigger selections
- Uses OpenAI to estimate:
  - Campgrounds/RV parks in the market
  - Estimated RV/camping sites
  - Estimated peak-season camper reach
  - Recommended package
  - Recommended weather triggers
  - Month-by-month campaign plan
- Sends all form data and AI-estimated fields to Smart 1 Suite via webhook
- Lets Smart 1 Suite handle document generation and email follow-up

## Important estimate disclaimer

This version does not use Google Maps, Google Places, OpenStreetMap, or paid ZIP-radius APIs. The campground count and camper reach are AI-generated planning estimates based on the dealership location, ZIP code, state, radius, and standard market assumptions. They should not be presented as audited counts.

  server.js              # Express backend
  package.json           # Node dependencies and scripts
  render.yaml            # Optional Render Blueprint config

## Local setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Add your environment variables:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
SMART1_SUITE_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-smart-1-suite-webhook-url
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

4. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

5. Open the local form:

```txt

# Render deployment instructions

## Option A: Deploy from GitHub manually

### 1. Create GitHub repository

Create a new GitHub repository named:

```txt
smart1rv
```

Push these project files to that repository.

### 2. Create a new Render Web Service

In Render:

1. Click **New +**
2. Choose **Web Service**
3. Connect your GitHub account if needed
4. Select the `smart1rv` repository
5. Use these settings:

```txt
Name: smart1rv
Runtime: Node
Branch: main
Root Directory: leave blank
Build Command: npm install
Start Command: npm start
Instance Type: Starter or higher
```

### 3. Add environment variables in Render

Go to the Render service → **Environment** and add:

```txt
OPENAI_API_KEY=your OpenAI API key
SMART1_SUITE_WEBHOOK_URL=your Smart 1 Suite webhook URL
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
NODE_ENV=production
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-smart1-site-domain.com,https://www.your-smart1-site-domain.com
```

For initial testing, you can temporarily leave `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` blank. Blank allows requests from any origin. After testing, lock it down to the Smart 1 Sites domain where the form is embedded.

### 4. Deploy

Click **Create Web Service**. Render will install dependencies and start the app.

### 5. Confirm deployment

After deploy, open:

```txt
https://YOUR-RENDER-SERVICE.onrender.com/health
```

You should see:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "service": "smart1rv",
  "timestamp": "..."
}
```

### 6. Test the hosted form

Open:

```txt
https://YOUR-RENDER-SERVICE.onrender.com
```

Fill out the form and confirm the lead arrives in Smart 1 Suite.

---

## Option B: Deploy with render.yaml Blueprint

This repo includes `render.yaml`.

In Render:

1. Click **New +**
2. Choose **Blueprint**
3. Connect the `smart1rv` repository
4. Render will read `render.yaml`
5. Add the required secret values when prompted:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `SMART1_SUITE_WEBHOOK_URL`
   - `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
6. Deploy

# Embedding in Smart 1 Sites

You have two options.

## Option 1: Embed with iframe

This is the easiest version.

```html
<iframe
  src="https://YOUR-RENDER-SERVICE.onrender.com"
  style="width:100%; min-height:1050px; border:0;"
  loading="lazy">
</iframe>
```

Pros:

- Fastest setup
- No CORS issues
- Keeps all form assets hosted on Render

Cons:

- Styling is inside iframe
- Height may need adjustment

## Option 2: Embed directly in a Smart 1 Sites code block

Use the HTML from `public/index.html`, CSS from `public/styles.css`, and JS from `public/script.js`.

Before the script, set your Render API base:

```html
<script>
  window.SMART1RV_API_BASE = "https://YOUR-RENDER-SERVICE.onrender.com";
</script>
<script src="https://YOUR-RENDER-SERVICE.onrender.com/script.js"></script>
```

Make sure `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in Render includes the Smart 1 Sites domain.

# Recommended Smart 1 Suite workflow

When the webhook fires:

1. Create or update contact by email
2. Create opportunity in the RV Demand pipeline
3. Store estimate fields as custom fields
4. Generate proposal document using custom values
5. Email proposal to `proposal_recipient_email`
6. Notify the assigned Smart 1 salesperson
7. Start follow-up automation if no appointment is booked

---

# Recommended Suite custom fields

Create custom fields for:

```txt
Dealership Name
Dealer Website URL
Dealer Address
Sales Radius Miles
Service Radius Miles
Primary Goal
Main Service Opportunity
Preferred Package Level
Selected Weather Triggers
Estimate Type

# Notes for production

- Keep the OpenAI API key only in Render environment variables.
- Never put API keys in Smart 1 Sites code blocks.
- Keep the Smart 1 Suite webhook URL only in Render environment variables.
- Use `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` after testing to reduce unwanted external submissions.
- Add captcha or honeypot protection if spam becomes an issue.
- Add server-side rate limiting if the page is publicly promoted.
